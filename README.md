#CreepMode

This addon is designed to allow users to use facebook 'readonly'. 

You can browse all you want without worrying about accidentally liking or commenting on something you didn't want to. Every Like, Comment, and Add Friend button has been hidden from view and cannot be clicked, so facebook creep away!
